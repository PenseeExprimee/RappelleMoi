## Getting Started

### Where is the idea coming from?

I am an engineer passionate about building applications and systems that address real-life challenges. With a strong interest in data science—particularly machine learning—I aspire to integrate my algorithms into apps and web platforms in the future.

In late 2024, I decided to dive into app development using Flutter. After completing an intensive 37-hour course (link below), I felt ready to take on my first project.

Imagine you have a small task: a quick errand, a call to return, or something to pack before leaving home. To avoid forgetting, you might jot it down in a note-taking app. But what if you forget to check that app? Adding it to your calendar might seem like a solution, but creating a full calendar event for something like "Buy toothpaste" feels excessive.

That’s where "Rappelle Moi" comes in. This app offers a simple and effective way to ensure you never overlook small but important tasks. You can create quick notes and set reminders, so the app sends you a notification at the right time. It's straightforward, user-friendly, and designed to make life easier.
